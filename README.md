I am a graduate student which means my blood is made up of 50% caffeine at all times. I study theoretical chemistry, which means I get to learn how to do a bunch of fancy computer stuff even though my computer background consists solely of making janky graphs on excel. So it's a pretty wild ride. 

If you've made it this far into this completely irrelevant file that I am creating as part of a GitHub tutorial, here's some free advice: never go up against a Sicilian when death is on the line. Or so I hear.
